Alphonso Davies was born in Buduburam, a refugee camp near Accra, Ghana. It was home to more than 12,000 refugees who fled Liberia during the First and Second Liberian Civil Wars. Alphonso Davies’s father and mother, Debeah and Victoria Davies, lived in Monrovia, Liberia, before they fled with their seven children during the Second Liberian Civil War (1999–2003). When Alphonso Davies was five, he and his family immigrated to Canada. They lived in Windsor, Ontario, before settling in Edmonton, Alberta, where Davies attended Mother Theresa Catholic School and St. Nicholas Catholic Junior High. Davies started playing organized soccer in the Free Footie Programme, an after-school initiative for lower-income, inner-city kids. He went on to play with Nicholas Academy, Edmonton Internationals, Edmonton Strikers and FC Edmonton for a brief period. “That’s where I started my soccer, that’s where I played, that’s where I went to school, that’s where my family and friends live,” Davies said to Global News in 2018.
